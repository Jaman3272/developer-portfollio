            <p> Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
                Latin
                literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
                Hampden-Sydney
                College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
                passage,
                and
                going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem
                Ipsum
                comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and
                Evil)
                by
                Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
                Renaissance.
                The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
